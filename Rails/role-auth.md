# tip from railsapp author

"For simple applications, CanCanCan or Pundit are not necessary and you can use simple role-based authorization without any extra authorization gems. I prefer Pundit when implementing authorization in a complex application. As an application grows in complexity, the CanCanCan Ability class can grow unwieldy. Also, every authorization request requires evaluation of the full CanCanCan Ability class, adding performance overhead.

If you need it, I've also written a Rails and Pundit Tutorial and example application."
