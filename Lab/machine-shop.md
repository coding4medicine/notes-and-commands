If all else fails, try a local custom bike or hot rod shop. They would do it as time allows. I would get an end mill that is just a little larger than the o.d. of the part you want to mill, center the mill on your piece and mill it in your drill press. Just have the workpiece really tightened down and take it kind of slow on the feed and medium to high speed on the drill motor.
