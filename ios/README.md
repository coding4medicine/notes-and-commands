parse vs firebase

https://www.quora.com/Cloud-Services-How-does-Firebase-differ-from-Parse


It depends on the use case. Parse was more of a general purpose BaaS and Firebase is  more of a realtime BaaS best suited for Realtime apps. Parse does not have realtime capabilities like Firebase, and Firebase does not have Push Notifications and CloudCode like Parse. If you're looking for more of Parse + Firebase, I'd encourage you to take a look into CloudBoost (https://www.cloudboost.io). It has Storage (Parse) + Realtime (Firebase) + Search (Algolia) all combined into one.
