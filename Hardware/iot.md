"Things," in the IoT sense, can refer to a wide variety of devices such as heart monitoring implants, biochip transponders on farm animals, electric clams in coastal waters,[15] automobiles with built-in sensors, DNA analysis devices for environmental/food/pathogen monitoring[16] or field operation devices that assist firefighters in search and rescue operations.[17] Legal scholars suggest to look at "Things" as an "inextricable mixture of hardware, software, data and service".[18] These devices collect useful data with the help of various existing technologies and then autonomously flow the data between other devices.[19][20] Current market examples include smart thermostat systems and washer/dryers that use Wi-Fi for remote monitoring.

We are currently on AWS. 
We signed a contract to move to Azure.

I have had nothing but troubles and issues. How can you sell an unfinished product????

Your documentation is NOT there, 
Your product is buggy as **** (cant even configure a set of servers to test my application) 
SUPPORT SUCKS AS ****. I opened a ticket and it goes unanswered for months!!!!

Do yourself a favor and work with Amazon AWS. LEARN from them. their support is beautiful.

Our company has now decided to reverse our contract with Microsoft and stay with Amazon AWS.

If for simply initial configuration there is no documentation, and no one to support me and I have to beg on internet so that someone have pity on me and tell me he is going to help because he knows some other guy inside Microsoft (and yes it has happened),, THEN simply think what **** would I go through if I put my production on this useless platform.

Ridiculous.

P.S. I am talking about ARM,
